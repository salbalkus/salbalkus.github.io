    "text": "GPT-3 is a large-scale natural language model developed by OpenAI that can perform many different tasks, including topic classification. Although researchers claim that it requires only a small number of in-context examples to learn a task, in practice GPT-3 requires these training examples to be either of exceptional quality or a higher quantity than easily created by hand. To address this issue, this study teaches GPT-3 to classify whether a question is related to data science by augmenting a small training set with additional examples generated by GPT-3 itself. This study compares two augmented classifiers: the Classification Endpoint with an increased training set size and the Completion Endpoint with an augmented prompt optimized using a genetic algorithm. We find that data augmentation significantly increases the accuracy of both classifiers, and that the embedding-based Classification Endpoint achieves the best accuracy of about 76%, compared to human accuracy of 85%. In this way, giving large language models like GPT-3 the ability to propose their own training examples can improve short text classification performance."

I am a PhD student in Biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\nMy research interests include causal inference, spatial statistics, and environmental health. I am currently advised by Professor Nima Hejazi.\nIn my free time, I enjoy illustrating scientific infographics and writing the occasional blog post for Harvard Science in the News. You can check out some of my work here.\nPreviously, I earned a BS in Data Science from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. As an undergraduate, I worked under Professor Hua Fang in the Computational Statistics and Data Science Lab on a variety of topics in smart health and distributed learning.\nBefore that, I spent time as a research assistant in the UMass Dartmouth Public Policy Center, where I studied the Blue Economy and social determinants of health in Southeastern New England."
