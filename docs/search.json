I am a third-year PhD student in Biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\nMy research interests include causal inference, spatial statistics, and environmental health. I am currently advised by Professor Nima Hejazi.\nPreviously, I earned my Bachelorâ€™s in Data Science from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. As an undergraduate, I worked under Professor Hua Fang in the Computational Statistics and Data Science Lab on a variety of topics in smart health and distributed learning.\nBefore that, I spent time as a research assistant in the UMass Dartmouth Public Policy Center, where I studied the Blue Economy and social determinants of health in Southeastern New England."
